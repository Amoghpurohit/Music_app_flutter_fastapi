def get_db():
    db = sessionLocal()
    try:
        yield db
    finally:
        db.close()   

here we have a created a function for injecting db as a dependency, db value is assigned and then we yield the db and the dependency is going to get 
resolved and the endpoint func is going to run and then the finally block is going to get executed

here we take care of lifecycle management, as db is utilized throughout the api route func and then after dependency is resolved its closed.


app = FastAPI()
app.include_router(router, prefix='/auth')
this is done so as to include all the new routes created into fastapi so that we dont have to create a new instance of fastapi everytime 
a new route is created and we give a different perfix for different set of routes, for that we can create different instances of APIRouter
